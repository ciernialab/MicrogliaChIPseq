To find a comprehensive list of the SRR files, we use the Run Selector.
Navigate to the bottom of the page and click “send to” and select “Run Selector”, and then press “go”.

Under the Select section click on the Metadata and List Accession to dowload the information on the experiment and the list of SRR files.
See screen shot image.
Use the SRR_Acc_List.txt as the samples list for the SRRpull.sh script

Trim with Trimmomatic for SE reads
    TrimSE.sh
    
Run FastQC on pre and post trim reads
    FastQC.sh
    
Run FastqScreen on post trimmed reads
    Fastqscreen.sh
    
Align using bowtie2 for SE reads
    sbatch Bowtie2alignment.sh
    
FIlter reads to remove PCR duplicates, remove unmapped reads and secondary alignments (multi-mappers)
We remove PCR duplicates using -F 0x400 
We then indext the reads and collect additional QC metrics using picard tools and samtools flagstat
QC meterics are then collected into one report using multiqc.

  sbatch samtoolsFilter.sh
  
  Run additional QC with Deeptools
  
    sbatch Deeptools.sh
    
 Make Tag directories on individual samples and pools. 
 From GEO: The tag directories for the input DNA were likewise combined. Peaks were then called on the pooled tags with the pooled input DNA as background using HOMER’s findPeaks command with the following parameters for the PU.1 ChIP-seq: “-style factor -size 200 -minDist 200” and the following parameters for the H3K27ac and H3K4me2 ChIP-seq: “-style histone -size 500 -minDist 1000 -region.” The “-tbp” parameter was set to the number of replicates in the pool.
 
 Tag directories for the ATAC-seq experiments were combined into an ex vivo and in vitro pool for both mouse and human. Peaks were then called on the pooled tags using HOMER’s findPeaks command with the following parameters: “-style factor -size 200 -minDist 200” with the “-tbp” parameter was set to the number of replicates in the pool.
